Run the CommandLineCourseReview class to use the command line implementation of course review.
Run the CourseReviewApplication class to use the GUI implementation of Course Review (half-finished).
We couldn't finish the GUI implementation on-time, currently you can not create any reviews in the GUI application but
everything else should work as intended.
